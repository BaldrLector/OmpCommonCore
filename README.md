This content supports readers of our book:

     The OpenMP Common Core: making OpenMP Simple Again

as they learn OpenMP.  Specific contents include:

      Book: Code used in the book.  This includes any
      code that appears in the figures as well as code
      fragments embedded in the the text of the book.
      We provide these in both C and Fortran.

      ChallengeProblems: A set of more complex problems to
      support advanced studies in OpenMP.  In each case
      we include serial code you can start with and a
      directory of solutions.  Currently, these are
      only provided for C.

      Exercises: code and solutions for the running 
      examples used in the book.  We recommend pausing 
      as you read the book and experimenting with these
      exercises ... afterall, we all learn most "by doing"
      We provide these in both C and Fortran.
      
      MakeDefs: Files included by our makefiles to support
      C and Fortran on various platforms.  You should copy
      one that is close to what you need, and modify it
      to reference the compilers you wish to use.  Put
      this copy in the MakeDefs director and call it make.def
